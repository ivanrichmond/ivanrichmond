# About Me #

Hi, I’m Ivan Richmond.

I’m interested in fullstack Javascript, using Node.  For the past several years, I've been using React.

My current personal project is https://github.com/ivanrichmond/hello.  Hello starts out with the premise that much of a software application is _not_ the actual code that causes the application to perform its purpose.  Rather, it's everything else: logging, user authentication, error handling, the UI framework, transpilation, config, unit testing, server-side DB, client-side DB, etc., etc.  All of these things are extremely important.  A good application needs all these things and is well architected from the beginning to work well and be easily maintainable.  Hello is, in essence, the empty shell of a full-stack Node/React application, which has all of these elements.  All it does is say "hello", either generically or do the logged in user.  That's not the point!  The point is everything else.  When finished, Hello will be a repo that can be forked to start a new Node/React project, with everything needed _exept_ the core functionality.
